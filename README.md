# covid_reporting

### Reason for Project

This project documents all of the code I wrote and maintain to report daily COVID statistics to the California Hospital Association (CHA) and the Nevada 
Hospital Association (NHA). CHA data is trasmitted to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), who transmits data up to Health and Human 
Services (HHS). NHA transmits to HHS. 

### Features of Project

This project uses three different programming languages (SQL, LaTeX, and Python), builds multiple files, and does all of the file management (including 
archives). The Python component has an interactive GUI. Example files are included to help you see what the underlying support files look like.
